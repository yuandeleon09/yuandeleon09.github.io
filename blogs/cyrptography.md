Cryptography

hash functions - plaintext - hash function - hashed text

ciphers

- symmetric encryption one session key (mas mabilis 100 to 1000 times faster than asymmetric)

-asymmetric encryption - two different session keys(public key and private key)

asymmetric cryptographic algo:

RSA - public-key cryptosystem

DSA - digital signature algo

ECDSA -  Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

symmetric cryptographic algo

DES - 3des Data Encryption Standard

IDEA -International Data Encryption Algorithm

AES - advanced encryption standard

RC -  Rivest's Cipher or Ron’s Code 

Transport encryption - VPN, IT sec, https, ssl,wpa2,

end-to-end encryption - application layer, layer 7, pineprevent ng other party mabasa yung data natin sender and receiver has the power to read the data. example: [signal](https://signal.org/) app


CA - free  digital certificate 

digital certificate - issued to, when na certified, Public key

to check if the certificate is legitimate here is the link to check [link](https://crt.sh/)

let’s encrypt free to register
